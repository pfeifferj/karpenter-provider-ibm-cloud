# Current Limitations and Constraints

This document outlines the current limitations, constraints, and known issues with the Karpenter IBM Cloud Provider.

## IBM Cloud Platform Limitations

### Networking Constraints

#### Zone Selection
An explicit zone/subnet pins placement. Omitting both enables automatic subnet selection. `Balanced` placement serializes per-NodeClass UID reservations, counts pending and active allocations, and keeps the selected zone across retries.

### Storage Limitations

#### Block Storage
`blockDeviceMappings` supports boot and data volumes with profile/IOPS settings. Omitting a root mapping preserves the default boot volume; at most one root mapping is allowed. Attachment names must be valid and unique. Persistent workloads should use Kubernetes storage classes.

#### No Instance Store Support
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot use local NVMe storage
- **Alternative**: Use IBM Cloud Block Storage

## Provider-Specific Limitations

### Bootstrap Mode Limitations

#### VPC Launch Recovery

VPC launches store their original configuration and use a name derived from the cluster and NodeClaim UIDs. Retries adopt a matching instance after a lost response. An uncertain submission with no visible instance remains pending for 15 minutes instead of issuing another create request; after that the checkpoint is discarded and the claim relaunches under the same name. Restore access to the original account and region and investigate the launch checkpoint before intervening in the claim's finalizer.

New VPC launches resolve and record the account from the VPC API key. Helm's optional `credentials.accountId` checks that the credential belongs to the expected account. Credential changes to another account block recovery and deletion instead of treating that account's 404 as proof of absence.

Older claims record account identity after a successful lookup of their exact instance. If that instance is already absent and the claim has no recorded account, it remains quarantined until an operator verifies the original account and records its ID in the `karpenter-ibm.sh/account-id` annotation. Existing resources without immutable ownership tags are excluded from automatic orphan deletion. Retained volumes are not removed by launch rollback.

#### IKS Mode Instance Type Constraints {#iks-mode-instance-type-constraints}

IKS provisioning requires `iksDynamicPools.enabled: true`, an explicit zone and subnet, and capacity for one dedicated pool per NodeClaim. Shared pools are not resized. `instanceProfile` selects the flavor; an optional `iksWorkerPoolID` supplies a flavor template. The provider checks the chosen flavor against the NodeClaim requirements and completes launch once the worker exists, reporting the flavor's catalog capacity until the Node registers its own resources.

Allocations preserve their original account, cluster, pool, and worker identity. Ambiguous cloud responses retain their allocation finalizer until ownership and deletion can be verified. Existing pools without immutable cluster and NodeClass ownership are excluded from automatic cleanup.

See [IKS integration](iks-integration.md) for configuration and recovery behavior.

### Tagging and Metadata

#### Basic Tagging Support
- **Current**: Limited tag management
- **Missing**:
  - Tag propagation from NodePool to instances
  - Dynamic tag updates
  - Cost allocation tags

#### Interruption Detection
Spot/preemption and running-instance checks require cloud ownership evidence before changing a claim. Detection depends on available cloud status; it does not guarantee advance notice.

### Networking Features

#### Load Balancer Integration
Configured targets are registered and saved for cleanup; deregistration failures retain finalizers. See [load-balancer integration](load-balancer-integration.md).

#### Limited Security Group Management
- **Current**: Uses default or specified security groups
- **Missing**: Dynamic security group creation and management
- **Workaround**: Pre-create security groups with required rules

## Pricing and Capacity
Unavailable, invalid, or nonpositive quotes produce no launchable offering. Successful pricing snapshots expire after 12 hours; refresh failures use a one-minute cooldown and retain the previous complete snapshot. Generation 2 pricing sums CPU/RAM components; later generations use exact regional instance-hour quotes and exclude optional OS charges.

Kubelet pod capacity defaults to 110; `maxPods` and `podsPerCore` constrain advertised and guest capacity. IKS API requests share a per-process 10 requests/second limit, burst 1; shared-public-IP traffic across processes needs an external aggregate limit.
