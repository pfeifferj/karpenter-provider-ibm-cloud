# Release Process

The Karpenter IBM Cloud Provider is released on an as-needed basis. The process is as follows:

1. An issue is proposing a new release with a changelog since the last release
2. All [OWNERS](OWNERS) must LGTM this release
3. An OWNER runs `git tag -s $VERSION` and inserts the changelog and pushes the tag with `git push $VERSION`
4. The release issue is closed
5. An announcement is made in the project's communication channels
